Hi, I'm Aditya 👋

I am a Machine Learning Researcher based in Jena, Germany, currently working at the **German Aerospace Center (DLR)**.

My research primarily revolves around **Time Series Anomaly Detection** in complex industrial systems. I use deep learning models to predict failures before they happen.
